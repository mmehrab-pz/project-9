                            Woman spends too much time on Codepens despite advice!!

                            Sometimes, Internet users land themselves in an uncommon situation where an app or website
                            can be used for both work and personal situations. Well, a young front-end designer was
                            spending up to 13 hours on the site, Codepen for work and her hobby, which unfortunately, is
                            also coding.
                            The designer, whose work includes a To-Do Terrarium, clarified, "Well, I didn't have to use
                            it for work but it was already part of my workflow. It just made sense as it was
                        </span>
                        <span style="padding-left: 15px;">
                            more efficient." The biggest issue, she said, is that she would hop on Codepen for work, but
                            would get distracted by pens made by others in the community for unexpectedly long periods
                            of time, which then causes her to spend even more time on the site.
                            "I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. Codepen, which brands itself as the best place
                            to build, test, and discover front-end code, has declined to comment at this time.

                                Making a floor Plan with CSS Grid? Talk about using the wrong tool for the job. But I
                                guess this is what happens when someone isn't happy with any of the floor plans found on
                                Pinterest; she'll start making her own

                                a large window to look out of pensively during rainy days and a ton of "white space" for
                                the cats to run around.

                        Something's gotta change," says the designer, who has requested to remain anonymous.
